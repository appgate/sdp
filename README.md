## Contributor and maintainer
Appgate Cybersecurity, Inc. employees are the current contributors. The repositories are a collection of use-cases, re-usable scenarios and tools from work with customers and internal IT for which we believe it is worth sharing to improve and add value to any Appgate-SDP installation. 
The content originates mostly from the *Customer Reliability Engineering team*, but also from the Appgate-SDP Services Team, Appgate-SDP Developement, Support and internal IT. 
We are continuously adding content over the coming months. With our intent to extend our GitHub presence, we are also aiming to incorporate community communications in the near future.
